Ideas for Building:

A help (?) button to give guidance on how to use the app
The score for each section rendered beside the name of the section
A popup window to give a printable or copyable table for sending results to other teachers.
Refactor the buttons and accordion with materialui or something else
Make sure that the textarea inputs can only be regular expressions and not code
